### Tree-search algorithms

In the "Tree-based algorithms" folder, there are algorithms available for selecting the next moves in games:
- Minimax algorithm
- Alpha-beta pruning algorithm
- MCTS algorithm (Monte Carlo Tree Search)

These algorithms can be tested for the game of tic-tac-toe using the "try_ai" script. The algorithms have been implemented based on the book "Deep Learning and the Game of Go" by Kevin Ferguson and Max Pumperla.

### Reinforcement learning algorithms

In the "RL algorithms" folder, there are algorithms available for training a neural network in the Cart Pole environment. The following algorithms are included:

- REINFORCE
- DQN (Deep Q-Network)
- Dueling DQN
- Actor-critic

These algorithms have been implemented based on the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems" by Aurélien Géron.
